## **Car Price Prediction Project - Detailed Explanation**

### **Project Overview**
This project is designed to predict the price of a car based on various attributes such as brand, model, year of manufacture, mileage, fuel type, and other key features. The primary goal is to develop a **Machine Learning (ML) model** that takes user inputs and estimates the car's value based on historical data.

### **Why is this project important?**
- **Helps buyers and sellers**: People looking to buy or sell a car can get a fair price estimate.
- **Automates price estimation**: Instead of manually checking multiple listings, this model can provide an instant estimate.
- **Utilizes Data Science**: It applies data cleaning, feature engineering, and predictive modeling to make accurate price predictions.

## **1. How does the project work?**
The project follows a structured **Machine Learning pipeline** to predict car prices:

### **Step 1: Data Collection**
The project requires a dataset that contains historical car sales data. This dataset includes information like:
- Car **brand** (e.g., Toyota, BMW, Ford)
- **Model** name (e.g., Corolla, Mustang)
- **Year of manufacture** (older cars are usually cheaper)
- **Mileage** (higher mileage generally reduces value)
- **Fuel type** (Petrol, Diesel, Electric, Hybrid)
- **Transmission** (Manual/Automatic)
- **Location** (prices vary based on market demand)
- **Previous owners** (fewer owners usually mean better price)
- **Condition** (Good, Average, Poor)

ðŸ“Œ **Where does this data come from?**
- Collected from online car sales websites like Cars.com, AutoTrader, or Kaggle datasets.
- Pre-existing structured datasets available in CSV format.

### **Step 2: Data Preprocessing**
Before using the data for training a model, we need to clean and process it:

âœ… **Handling missing values**: Some cars may have missing attributes, which are either filled or removed.  
âœ… **Removing duplicates**: Ensuring data does not have repeated entries.  
âœ… **Feature engineering**: Creating new features such as "car age" (current year - manufacture year).  
âœ… **Encoding categorical variables**: Since machine learning models do not understand text, categorical values like "fuel type" and "transmission" are converted into numbers.

**Example:**
| Brand  | Year | Mileage | Fuel Type | Price  |
|--------|------|---------|-----------|--------|
| Toyota | 2018 | 30,000  | Petrol    | $20,000 |
| Ford   | 2015 | 50,000  | Diesel    | $15,000 |

After encoding fuel type:
| Brand  | Year | Mileage | Fuel Type_Petrol | Fuel Type_Diesel | Price  |
|--------|------|---------|------------------|------------------|--------|
| Toyota | 2018 | 30,000  | 1                | 0                | $20,000 |
| Ford   | 2015 | 50,000  | 0                | 1                | $15,000 |

### **Step 3: Model Training**
After preprocessing, we train a **machine learning model** using the cleaned data.

ðŸš€ **Which ML models are used?**
- **Linear Regression**: Basic approach to estimate price based on features.
- **Decision Trees**: Can handle non-linear relationships between car attributes and price.
- **Random Forest**: More accurate as it combines multiple decision trees.
- **Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, CatBoost, etc.)**: Advanced models that refine predictions over time.

---

### **Step 4: Model Deployment with Flask**
Once the model is trained, it is integrated into a **Flask web application**.  

ðŸ”¹ **Flask** is a lightweight Python framework that helps serve the model as a web application.

- A user can **input car details** through a simple web form.
- The backend **processes the inputs**, applies the trained model, and **returns the predicted price**.
- The result is displayed on the webpage in a user-friendly manner.

ðŸ“Œ **Example user input on the website:**
- **Brand:** Toyota  
- **Year:** 2020  
- **Mileage:** 15,000 km  
- **Fuel Type:** Petrol  

ðŸ’¡ **Predicted Price:** $22,500

## **2. Technologies Used**
The project consists of **three main components**: frontend, backend, and machine learning.

### **Frontend (User Interface)**
The website where users enter car details:
- **HTML** (for webpage structure)
- **CSS** (for styling)
- **JavaScript** (for interactive elements)

### **Backend (Server & API)**
Handles user requests and returns predictions:
- **Python & Flask** (for backend logic)
- **scikit-learn** (for machine learning)
- **Pandas & NumPy** (for data processing)

### **Database (Optional)**
If the project stores historical predictions, it might use:
- **SQLite** (for lightweight data storage)
- **MySQL/PostgreSQL** (for larger datasets)

## **3. How to Run the Project Locally?**
### **Step 1: Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nesrinedroul/CarPricePrediction.git
cd CarPricePrediction
```

### **Step 2: Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**
```bash
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # Windows: env\Scripts\activate
```

### **Step 3: Install Required Packages**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **Step 4: Run the Application**
```bash
flask run
```

âœ… The web app will start, and you can access it at **http://127.0.0.1:5000/**.
